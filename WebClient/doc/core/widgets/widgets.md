# Widgets

Widgets are small UI parts that can be used to build up application UI. These parts don't contain any application logic but only are basic small building blocks for UI.

| Widget | Description |
|---|---|
| [CloseButton](./closeButton/closeButton.md) | A simple widget that implements a close button. |
| [DockButton](./dockButton/dockButton.md) | A widget that represents a button for dock and undock actions. This is only a button and doesn't implement the docking behavior. |
| [Tooltip](./tooltip/tooltip.md) | A simple widget that implements a tooltip. |
