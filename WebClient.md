#Web client
part of the ecodistrict design module.

The web client is the user interface of the design module. This module is used to visualize geo information in a case and its variants. It can also be used to show graphs of district wide data.

The second function of the design module is to apply measures to the whole of the district or to selected objects. These measures result in underlying data to be changed and recalculated.

The third function is to show and manipulate properties of selected objects directly.

All information is organised in domains and previews of layers and graphs can be filtered by switching domains on or off to make selection of layers and graphs easier.
